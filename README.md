# Norman-Lab
Repository for projects in the Norman lab -- Namely creating a WMEM model of the Dual Retro-Cue Task
Here we compare simple RNN (WM) models, DNDLSTM (WM + EM) models, and DND w/ context representation (WMEM) models of the DRC task on neural networks to and use isomorphism between the models and the human brain in order to determine whether or not the WMEM hypothesis is a valid understanding of activity silence in neurons over the ASWM hypothesis

See https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136466132100005X for more details on this hypothesis
